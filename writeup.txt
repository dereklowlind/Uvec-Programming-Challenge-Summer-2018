Planning process
In order to make a functioning prototype in the time provided we abstracted the problem to a simpler form. The number of days from Sept 10 to Nov 30 is 81, or 4 days more than 11 weeks. We decided for simplicity of implementation to leave the last 4 days free from any assignments, labs, or midterms. The last 4 days would also be nice as a course wrap up and to resolve any left over work due to unforeseen conflicts. Finals will be treated as a separate problem for now as the time provided does not overlap.
